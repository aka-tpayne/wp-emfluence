Easily add forms to your website for contacts to add or update their details in your emfluence Marketing Platform account.


== Description ==

If you're a user of the emfluence Marketing Platform, this plugin is for you!

Easily add any number of widgetized forms to your website. Each widget can have different input fields and add contacts
to different contact groups.

Note that you'll likely want to tailor the forms to your theme using some CSS. You can also template the success message
by copying the theme/success.php file from this plugin to your theme, if you wish (or just type out a success message
in widget settings).
